# Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML
This repository contains an implementation of Heart Disease Prediction using various Machine Learning Classification Techniques.<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can classify whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators.<br>

Key Features:<br>
Dataset: Utilizes a publicly available heart disease dataset.<br>
Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and selects relevant features.<br>
ML Models: Implements multiple classification algorithms, including:<br>

Logistic Regression<br>
Decision Tree<br>
Random Forest<br>
Support Vector Machine (SVM)<br>
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<br>
Na√Øve Bayes<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Compares model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.<br>
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes models for better prediction accuracy.<br>
Visualization: Provides graphical representations of model performance and data distribution.<br>
Technologies Used:<br>
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)<br>
Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization<br>
Usage:<br>
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate models.<br>
